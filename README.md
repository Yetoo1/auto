# auto
Tool to auto-start specified programs with parameters in a lightweight/cross platform manner. The point of this is to have a single file which is an executable that will automatically execute user specified programs with relevant flags. This is essentially a glorified shortcut. In the future there will be a wrapper/script/program that's an abstraction to msbuild or make depending on os to pass a precompiler definition with user specified string in that. At somepoint I want to make this into a self compiling executable to remove the wrapper. Probably there'd be some tool to autoinject the source code into the the initial source code, but that just be for development, but also eventually there would be command line options to reset the code to initial state and add scod to hard code rather than use the wrapper. For now, edit commandString in main and separate by \n and remember to escape proper characters, more documentation in main.
