# auto
Tool to auto-start specified programs with parameters in a lightweight/cross platform manner.
The point of this is to have a single file which is an executable that will automatically execute user specified programs with relevant flags.
This is essentially a glorified shortcut.
In the future there will be a wrapper/script/program that uses msbuild to pass a precompiler definition with user specified string in that.
For now, edit commandString in main and separate by \n and remember to escape proper characters, more documentation in main.
